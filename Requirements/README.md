## Introduction

The Cricket Scorecard Management System is a very simple project which is programmed using c language. This project uses the method of file handling where the data of runs, name of the players, wickets, strike rates are stored in the file.

When the project is executed first of all the welcome screen is displayed with the main menu. The menu will contain three options such as new score sheet, view score sheet and the last one exit.

If you pressed 1 then the project asks for the file name where the data will be stored. After creating a file the user starts entering the data and that data is stored in the given file.

After entering the data the program will ask you to press ‘e’ for edit or to press ‘c’ to continue. And the last option is the exit where the project is closed
